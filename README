HEAVYBOXES - DOM Physics

=========================================================================

1) ABOUT

HeavyBoxes is a Javascript library adding physics to DOM elements using 
Box2D and HTML/CSS transforms (rotation).

Heavyboxes was written to implement "episode 1" for http://rianflo.com.
The funny thing about having DOM nodes flying around is that you can still 
click, drag, select, submit a form or do whatever the normal elements 
can do. I wonder what fun things can be created around that effect. 
Maybe we really need to fill out upside-down forms while birds are 
bumping into the submit button?
If you make anything, I'd love to hear about it.

2) BASIC USAGE

Dependencies: heavyboxes.js still uses the version of box2djs which 
depends on prototypejs. Personally I am not a big fan of that and many 
might agree, but it works for now. All other dependencies for the example 
are in /lib.

// 1: Initialize the physics world inside the world div.
// This will create a frame of static bodies around the div's boundries 
// to keep objects from falling outside of the world. The div need a 
// fixed size or the behavior is undefined.

var heavyBoxes = new HeavyBoxes($('world'));
heavyBoxes.run();

// 2: create a dom element or tree of elements (don't attach it yet)
var newDiv = document.createElement("div");
newContent = document.createTextNode("Hi there and greetings!");
// add the text node to the newly created div.
newDiv.appendChild(newContent); 

// 3: add physics body and add to world/DOM
// add at position (120, 60) with initial velocity (-10, 0)
var actor = heavyBoxes.addBox(120, 60, newDiv, -10, 0);

Also check out example1.html for the original 
implementation of "Twittershitter".

Enjoy!
